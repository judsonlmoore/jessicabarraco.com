					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, If there&#8217;s one thing I was raised without, it was hope. Hope is this intangible thing I&#8217;ve had to teach myself to believe in without much proof of. I&#8217;m no lawyer, but I am quite inquisitive, so for that reason, hope is always both my best friend and enemy in life. Hope makes me feel inadequate sometimes, as if I&#8217;m almost unworthy of its gifts because I don&#8217;t *always* believe. I wasn&#8217;t born a Disney princess. While I [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, I lived through the first (I think?) NYC hurricane. At first, I wasn&#8217;t bothered by it. I thought, hurricane on Madison Avenue? Come on, now. Who cares. Mellow out. But half of Manhattan closed up, boarded up and was sealed to the eye of the storm. There&#8217;s something about seasonal meltdowns that cause me my own flood of emotions. I&#8217;m sure it will get worse tomorrow, as I&#8217;ll be &#8220;Castaway&#8221; in my own tiny apartment especially made for [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, If you&#8217;ve tried to find me on Facebook and failed, it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m not on it. I relinquished the control that social media had on my life (except this website) about six months ago and it feels great! No more can I stalk the random girl I did not care about in college and internalize minute jealousy that she&#8217;s engaged before me, and no longer do I keep tabs on every drunken hook-up I had in college.
