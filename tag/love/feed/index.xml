					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, If you ever get a chance to meet my boyfriend, and care to ask him what my favorite things are he would say this in this order: “Organizing, throwing stuff away, and laundry.” OK, I will admit I am a Virgo. I make my bed every morning (and will risk being late to do so). I grew up in a messy environment to say the least. There were mounds of crap everywhere like you might see on an [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, Settling. What a loaded word, huh? It used to just mean where your house was, or where you would camp out for the night. And now it means so many things. It means you sold out, you missed good chances, you took what was in front of you instead of waiting for what made you feel alive. I&#8217;m afraid I might have done that recently with something I care about more than anything in the world. I hate [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, I am tired. Exhausted. Insightful. Smarter. I am having to go through the exercise of tagging my posts from the past three years. Yes &#8211; Jessicabarraco.com is nearly THREE years old! I can&#8217;t believe it either. And we&#8217;re giving her a facelift before things really start take off with The Butterfly Groove &#8211; and life. I want my website to look as prepared as I feel. And now, when you read a blog post you like of mine, [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, Is it just me or are you suffering from excuse-overload? I am so tired of hearing people&#8217;s excuses. Why do they feel the need to make them? The only reason you should make excuses as far as I&#8217;m concerned, is if you&#8217;re trying to get out of a workout class with strict cancellation policies and you would otherwise be charged upwards of $40 if you don&#8217;t show up&#8230; and you have cramps. I cannot come up with any [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, Catching the bouquet, or as I like to say, &#8220;I won the bouquet!&#8221; The history of this term comes from the 14th and 15th centuries, according to Yahoo! Answers. &#8220;There was an ancient belief that certain herbs contained in the bridal bouquet were good luck. In order to pass on this luck, the bride would choose a friend to present the bouquet to at the end of the wedding.&#8221; I caught it free and clear last weekend, I [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, I&#8217;m not sure why I seem to run into so many people who are limited emotionally. Is it an epidemic that runs rampant in men in their 20&#8217;s and early 30&#8217;s? I looked it up in the Thesaurus to find synonyms for limited. They are abhorrent words like inhibit, reduce, restrain, constrict, narrow and hinder. These are all terrible words that I associate with negativity, people who can&#8217;t enjoy life, people who are so afraid to let go [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, It saddens me so much to write this post. My only writing icon and legend, Nora Ephron, has passed away. When I moved to NYC last year, I really thought I would be able to meet her at one point. Right before I moved, I read her most recent book, I Remember Nothing. In it, she speaks about what she will miss and what she won&#8217;t in her life. Among things she will miss, coming over the bridge [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, I haven&#8217;t written in so long. You must have thought I abandoned my own website. Or someone hacked into it who could care less about writing. I have been going through a lot of changes. Usually I don&#8217;t agree with the statement: change is good, but right now I do. There&#8217;s nothing like reflecting back to last Memorial day and being so happy it was a year ago. It&#8217;s kind of amazing what can happen in a year. [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, I am really slacking with my posts. Winter has slowed me down, I suppose. If I were in Smash, trying to get a musical from workshop to the big stage, I would probably fail. I can&#8217;t even keep up with my own blog. Sometimes I wish I was trying out for broadway. I was a performer in a different life, I think. I mean, if you ask my close friends, I could still wing it. I&#8217;m sort of [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, Why do people always say that? It’s like some terrible Hallmark saying that has gone way out of style. I don’t believe that there is one person who could make you happy, one person who can further your career and one opportunity that changes everything. I simply don’t. It is all people see because the world is so vast that you can’t fathom that other things/peoples/careers/places might make you happy because it is too difficult to bear that [&#8230;]</p>
