					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, It saddens me so much to write this post. My only writing icon and legend, Nora Ephron, has passed away. When I moved to NYC last year, I really thought I would be able to meet her at one point. Right before I moved, I read her most recent book, I Remember Nothing. In it, she speaks about what she will miss and what she won&#8217;t in her life. Among things she will miss, coming over the bridge [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, I haven&#8217;t written in so long. You must have thought I abandoned my own website. Or someone hacked into it who could care less about writing. I have been going through a lot of changes. Usually I don&#8217;t agree with the statement: change is good, but right now I do. There&#8217;s nothing like reflecting back to last Memorial day and being so happy it was a year ago. It&#8217;s kind of amazing what can happen in a year. [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, If there&#8217;s one thing I was raised without, it was hope. Hope is this intangible thing I&#8217;ve had to teach myself to believe in without much proof of. I&#8217;m no lawyer, but I am quite inquisitive, so for that reason, hope is always both my best friend and enemy in life. Hope makes me feel inadequate sometimes, as if I&#8217;m almost unworthy of its gifts because I don&#8217;t *always* believe. I wasn&#8217;t born a Disney princess. While I [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, I am really slacking with my posts. Winter has slowed me down, I suppose. If I were in Smash, trying to get a musical from workshop to the big stage, I would probably fail. I can&#8217;t even keep up with my own blog. Sometimes I wish I was trying out for broadway. I was a performer in a different life, I think. I mean, if you ask my close friends, I could still wing it. I&#8217;m sort of [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, Today I remember my mother. She has been gone for twelve years today and it still feels like yesterday that I was sitting in my algebra class, and felt my heart sink at 2:42pm. I knew she was gone. I felt her leave the Earth – like so many loved ones report feeling. You know when loved ones are departing, or when they are in danger, or at worst, dead. I have devoted the past two years of [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, When is the college try going to go out of style? Let’s recap from the urban dictionary for those of you who aren’t familiar with lazy, easily discouraged people/majors/projects that mimic that of a college student’s intent. College Try: Giving something your best shot, even if you aren&#8217;t sure how to do it. Attempting the &#8220;old college try&#8221; always results in uncontrolled rage and frustration rather than learning. This condition is only augmented by trying to find help [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, I just had my first walking through lower Manhattan meltdown. It was a good one too. For some reason, on a Monday there were tons of people out and everyone seemed to be looking me straight in the eye. All those dark, enigmatic streets you hear about in crime stories dissipated into over-lit scaffolding and well-lit corners. Must have been Guiliani. I had gotten a goodbye text from someone who should have been superlatively unimportant in my life, [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, One of the first justifications I gave myself for moving to NYC was, &#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid of being hit by a car.&#8221; Growing up driving in California, how could I be? It&#8217;s not that hard to see pedestrians, and it&#8217;s not that hard to put your foot on the break last-minute. I love J-walking, in fact. I&#8217;m such a wimp, I get a little thrill out of it without a total, all-consuming adrenaline rush that is otherwise abhorrent [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, I almost got F-ed on the F train today. And I don’t mean that literally. I was running late to work: my hair was in a bun which just proves how rushed I felt, considering my hair hasn’t been in a bun since a dance recital in Irvine circa 1994. I’m riding the train and it appears that I’m on an E train because the little sign is showing me that we’re approaching 23rd street. But all of [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, The only thing that can be sometimes nerve-racking about being me is when things are actually going well and I’m suddenly concerned that somebody might be reading this blog and understand exactly what or who I’m referring to. I guess that’s the price I pay for being an aspiring author. I chose to be honest with the world and share my non-fiction life in a fiction-like way. Usually I complain to you, but today I’m not. Today the [&#8230;]</p>
