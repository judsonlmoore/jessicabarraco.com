					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, I know what you&#8217;re thinking. And no, I have not decided to be extremely focused and train for a marathon (like everyone else in big cities in 2013). This is more a metaphor for how I&#8217;m feeling in life right now. I have some great news &#8212; an agent for The Butterfly Groove, a job that is about something I really care about and is slowing down for the summer, and dating isn&#8217;t even going so badly&#8230; Yet, [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, I&#8217;m not sure why I seem to run into so many people who are limited emotionally. Is it an epidemic that runs rampant in men in their 20&#8217;s and early 30&#8217;s? I looked it up in the Thesaurus to find synonyms for limited. They are abhorrent words like inhibit, reduce, restrain, constrict, narrow and hinder. These are all terrible words that I associate with negativity, people who can&#8217;t enjoy life, people who are so afraid to let go [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, It saddens me so much to write this post. My only writing icon and legend, Nora Ephron, has passed away. When I moved to NYC last year, I really thought I would be able to meet her at one point. Right before I moved, I read her most recent book, I Remember Nothing. In it, she speaks about what she will miss and what she won&#8217;t in her life. Among things she will miss, coming over the bridge [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, I am so tired of having conversations or taking part in anything that does not belong to me. Is that messed up? Selfish, even? You might think so at first, but what I&#8217;m saying has a lot of truth to it. I just got home from an author event where the only cute guy there who took interest in asking me normal questions about my life inevitably has a girlfriend. He did not bring this up until we [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, Why do people always say that? It’s like some terrible Hallmark saying that has gone way out of style. I don’t believe that there is one person who could make you happy, one person who can further your career and one opportunity that changes everything. I simply don’t. It is all people see because the world is so vast that you can’t fathom that other things/peoples/careers/places might make you happy because it is too difficult to bear that [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, Have you ever hit a point in your life where you feel like you wish you were an exterminator? That&#8217;s right. You heard me. I wish I had never gone to journalism school and that I instead went to pest control school because then maybe I wouldn&#8217;t have mice and roaches in my $1,300 a month apartment in the city. WTF is up with that?! Also, knowing how to trap and kill pests might aid me in dating. [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, You know what’s a better description for the word, coincidence? Meaningful nothings. That’s what they are. Coincidence sounds so scientific. I get the essence of the word – coincide – a coincidence is when two otherwise unrelated things align in an odd occurrence of solidarity. They are little messages from the universe saying, “Hey, what’s up guys – here I am!” Sometimes it’s a way of people from beyond giving us living people a message, I like to [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, It&#8217;s raining outside. Like the sky is mad. I have no clue why the sky is so mad given that the two states I&#8217;ve spent the most time in are California and Colorado, and the sky is always shining and smiling there. Also has a close relationship to the sun I&#8217;ve heard before. I also have no idea why the sky is mad considering it&#8217;s April. Having never truly witnessed April showers, boy am I getting a taste [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, Baggage. Why do people have so much of it? Every day in New York City, I walk to and from work and see, five, maybe ten people dragging suitcases. I don’t mean laptop cases because you have scoliosis or something (G-d forbid), I mean, big, honkin’ Samsonite pieces of luggage. First of all: Samsonite? Really? I thought that brand peaked in 1991 when “Dumb &#38; Dumber” plugged them. Haven’t seen much from them since. Secondly: we have these [&#8230;]</p>
