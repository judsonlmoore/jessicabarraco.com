					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, I am tired. Exhausted. Insightful. Smarter. I am having to go through the exercise of tagging my posts from the past three years. Yes &#8211; Jessicabarraco.com is nearly THREE years old! I can&#8217;t believe it either. And we&#8217;re giving her a facelift before things really start take off with The Butterfly Groove &#8211; and life. I want my website to look as prepared as I feel.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, I had the oddest experience on the subway yesterday. I took a line I don’t usually take at an hour I don’t usually take it, and it was like a whole new world. It felt almost like a bar on a Friday or Saturday night: everyone was chatting amongst themselves and really excited to be off of work even though it was only a Wednesday. However, there was another strange occurrence. Three young, cute businessmen were checking me [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>You were on my mind. Yeah, you were on my mind. Dear Friends, The song I&#8217;m quoting is by We Five, a one-hit wonder band of 1965. This was me and my mom&#8217;s song. We used to listen to it on K-EARTH 101.1, the Oldies station. I have the fondest memories of riding around in my mom&#8217;s silver Volvo station wagon with her, listening to Oldies. But especially this song.
