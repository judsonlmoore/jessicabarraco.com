					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, Today I remember my mother. She has been gone for twelve years today and it still feels like yesterday that I was sitting in my algebra class, and felt my heart sink at 2:42pm. I knew she was gone. I felt her leave the Earth – like so many loved ones report feeling. You know when loved ones are departing, or when they are in danger, or at worst, dead. I have devoted the past two years of [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, You know what’s a better description for the word, coincidence? Meaningful nothings. That’s what they are. Coincidence sounds so scientific. I get the essence of the word – coincide – a coincidence is when two otherwise unrelated things align in an odd occurrence of solidarity. They are little messages from the universe saying, “Hey, what’s up guys – here I am!” Sometimes it’s a way of people from beyond giving us living people a message, I like to [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, I am NOT a morning person. In fact, I hate the morning. The worst things happen in the morning. You have to wake yourself up out of your own slumber, and realize that whatever happened the day before is now further away from you, such that you might have to question yourself if it’s actually there anymore. There’s this pathetic song from the 1960’s, “Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,” that maps a girl’s inner angst as to [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, Last week I wrote about being “bitten” and this week I feel that I have bit myself in the ass – and it’s only Tuesday. Oh, boy. Sometimes I feel like I have an inner girl in me that I let loose. This inner girl is not very cool. She has zero self control and thinks she says things tactfully when they’re actually everything but. My mother taught me to always speak my mind, but sometimes I feel [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, Meaningless coincidences. Isn&#8217;t the world full of them? I&#8217;m constantly running into someone, making note of something with valid, mystic connection, and wondering about the time sequence of something that truly translates into meaningless nothing. Someone crosses my mind, and that second they answer my call or I receive an email from them; I think about someone who lives in California, and then I see them in my neighborhood in NYC, just crossing the street. I tell a [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>You were on my mind. Yeah, you were on my mind. Dear Friends, The song I&#8217;m quoting is by We Five, a one-hit wonder band of 1965. This was me and my mom&#8217;s song. We used to listen to it on K-EARTH 101.1, the Oldies station. I have the fondest memories of riding around in my mom&#8217;s silver Volvo station wagon with her, listening to Oldies. But especially this song. It was &#8220;our song.&#8221; It was the first experience I [&#8230;]</p>
