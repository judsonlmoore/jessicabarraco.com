					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, Is it just me or are you suffering from excuse-overload? I am so tired of hearing people&#8217;s excuses. Why do they feel the need to make them? The only reason you should make excuses as far as I&#8217;m concerned, is if you&#8217;re trying to get out of a workout class with strict cancellation policies and you would otherwise be charged upwards of $40 if you don&#8217;t show up&#8230; and you have cramps. I cannot come up with any [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, My Barbie Room was the best part of my childhood. Inside this room, on Barbie Lane, everything was perfect. No one had cancer and no one was dying. Kens were monogamists – even though there were only three of them, and there were big Barbie families – the smallest one had three children. The families took turns living in the neon pink dream house. They took turns being doctors, lawyers and models. They took turns loving each other. [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends, Recent experiences have led me to believe that girls and boys didn&#8217;t just stop getting along. They have never gotten along. Boys have always been more simple-minded; conflict minimalists that do not want to hash anything out for too long. Two 11-year-old boys taught me that this week. They were trying to help sort a problem out with their friends (who were girls) and they sounded so calm and sane, yet the girls were annoyed at their calmness. [&#8230;]</p>
